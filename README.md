ðŸ”¹ Painting Job â€“ Quarts to Gallons
The program helps calculate how many gallons and leftover quarts are needed for a painting job. It does this by dividing the number of quarts by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). The interactive version allows the user to input the number of quarts instead of using a fixed value.

ðŸ’¬ Example output:
A job that needs 18 quarts requires 4 gallons plus 2 quarts.
